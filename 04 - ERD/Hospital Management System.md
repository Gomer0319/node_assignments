### Assignment: Hospital Management System

In this assignment, you will design an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) for a Hospital Management System. The purpose of this task is to help you understand and apply the principles of database design, focusing on the identification of entities, their attributes, and the relationships between them. You will create a visual representation of the systemâ€™s data model, which will serve as the foundation for a well-structured and efficient database.

Use this wireframe as a reference to ensure that your ERD aligns with the user flows and functionalities depicted.
