3. Implement CRUD Operations:
    - **Create New Records:** Implement routes to create new books and authors and assign them to each other.
    - **Read Records:** Implement routes to list all books and authors. When clicking on a book or author, show their related records (e.g., authors of a book or books of an author).
    - **Delete Records:** Implement functionality to delete books and authors, ensuring that the associations are handled correctly.
4. Test Your Application:
    - Make sure that all routes work as expected. Check that you can create, view, and delete records and that the associations between books and authors are correctly managed.

**MVP Requirements: Many-to-Many Relationship Management**

1. **Index Page:**
    - Create a route to show a list of all books and all authors on a single page.
    - Ensure that each entry in the list is clickable to view more details.
2. **Details Pages:**
    - **For Books:** Create a route to show all authors associated with a selected book.
    - **For Authors:** Create a route to show all books written by a selected author.
3. **Create New Records:**
    - Implement routes to create new books and authors.
    - Include functionality to assign authors to books and vice versa when creating new records.
4. **Delete Records:**
    - Implement routes to delete books and authors.
    - Ensure that deleting a book or author correctly updates the associations.
5. **Routes:**
    - **/books/new:** Route to create a new book and assign authors to it.
    - **/authors/new:** Route to create a new author and assign books to them.

**Expected Outputs**

- **Index Page:** A single page displaying all books and authors. Each entry should be clickable to view more details.
- **Book Details Page:** A page that lists all authors associated with the selected book, with a clear view of the relationships.
- **Author Details Page:** A page that lists all books associated with the selected author, showing the connections clearly.
- **Create New Records:** Forms that allow for the creation of new books and authors, with functionality to assign relationships between them.
- **Delete Records:** Functionality that allows for the deletion of books and authors, ensuring that relationships are updated correctly without orphaned records.
