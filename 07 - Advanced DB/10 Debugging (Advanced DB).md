# Debugging Assignment: Fixing a One-to-Many Movie Application
# Debugging Assignment

In this assignment, you'll be provided with a simple Express and TypeScript application designed to manage movies and their reviews. The application has several intentional errors that you need to debug and fix. This includes issues with routes, types, and CRUD operations for a one-to-many relationship.

**Estimated Time to Completion:** 90 mins

**Level of Complexity:** Medium

## Instructions

1. **Download and Review:** Download the provided application code. Review the existing code and identify areas with potential issues.

2. **Identify and Fix Errors:**

    - **Routes:** Correct any incorrectly defined or implemented routes.
    - **Types:** Fix TypeScript type errors.
    - **Models:** Ensure the Sequelize models are correctly defined with proper one-to-many relationships (Movies and Reviews).
    - **CRUD Operations:** Make sure that Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for movies and reviews are functioning correctly.

3. **Test:** Run the application and test each route to ensure all CRUD operations work as expected.

4. **Submit:** Provide a link to your fixed code repository on GitHub.

## Evaluation Criteria & Learning Objectives

- **Correct Routes:** Ensure all routes are correctly defined and mapped.
- **Fixed Types:** Resolve TypeScript type issues.
- **Proper Model Definitions:** Confirm that Sequelize models are correctly defined with one-to-many relationships between movies and reviews.
- **Functional CRUD Operations:** Verify that all CRUD operations are working properly.
- **Testing:** Ensure that the application behaves correctly when tested.

## Directions

1. **Download the Provided Code:** You will be given a zip file containing a simple Express and TypeScript application with intentional issues related to movies and reviews. <br>
**Download here:** [Movies & Reviews](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1R5eiX6arWu0peoH63JEVRO6Cr9YeclBN/view?usp=sharing)

2. **Debug the Application:**

    - **Routes:** Check and correct any routing issues. Ensure routes are properly handling CRUD operations for movies and reviews.
    - **Types:** Look for TypeScript errors and resolve them to ensure type safety.
    - **Models:** Verify that Sequelize models for movies and reviews are correctly set up with a one-to-many relationship. A movie should have many reviews.
    - **CRUD Operations:** Test and fix CRUD operations for both movies and reviews to ensure they work correctly. This includes creating, reading, updating, and deleting.

3. **Test and Verify:** Run the application, test each endpoint, and ensure that all CRUD operations and relationships function as intended.

4. **Submit:** Upload your corrected code to GitHub and share the repository link.
